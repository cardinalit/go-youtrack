# YouTrack for Go

Bare bones YouTrack REST API client library for Go that provides authentication
using [Permanent Token Authorization](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/incloud/authentication-with-permanent-token.html).

The `youtrack.Api` type provides methods for making authenticated HTTP GET and POST requests to the
[YouTrack REST API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/incloud/youtrack-rest-api-reference.html).

There are also some convenience functions for creating issues.

Contributions welcome.
